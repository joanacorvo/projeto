<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>In a way to learn how Design Systems are made and how to use them, the challenge was to make an Interface for a product and make a design system from scratch for it.</p>

<h4>Cheer Brew is there for you!</h4>
<p>“When your mind is wandering, or just plain bored, coffee can be your friend. If you are feeling down, or just want to get fresh air, try this: go ahead and pour yourself a cup of coffee.”</p>

<h3>Design System</h3>
<p>As for most projects, this one started with explorations and research on the multiple elements of the design system. How are colours perceived? What is the best size for buttons? What is the purpose of placeholders and helper text? Should I use indicators for the mandatory inputs or only mark the optional spaces? How to make the interface accessible to the users?
The colours were a very important part of the project, since the main purpose of the product is to make people feel happy, warm and calm the colours had to represent that. Thus the use of orange, a muted green and a dash of yellow.
</p>
<p>It was an ever changing process through the project, to make sure the assets were good for both the interface and the product.
I also had to keep in mind that I had to make the system ready to use in case it were to be implemented and had to have more people working with it, for which I had to look on how components and variants work and how to use auto-layout to make the buttons and inputs changeable without losing their main layout.</p>

<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
<p>After choosing the product I had to search what the coffee online market looks like and learn what makes them special and how their interfaces work. I looked into three different categories: smaller national company, similar to my own product; a national well known company; and a multinational company. All three had valuable ideas that I took into account while making my own product and interface.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>Sketches and wireframes were necessary to make important decisions on what would be the best strategies to show a product to sell. They shaped the structure and the process of how the interface works. Here was a part of the project where it was necessary to both experiment ideas and then narrow down to those that worked best.</p>
