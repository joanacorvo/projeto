 <h3>The Challenge</h3>
 <p>For this project we had to pick an already existing  app and design a brand new feature that felt purposeful. Our goal was to design a feature that could feel both useful and fresh.</p>
 </div>
 <div>
 <h3>The Solution</h3>
 <p>...So we design Nike AR. Combining both Augmented Reality and Customization, we wanted to close the gap between customers and retail created by the pandemic by allowing anyone to try-on their favorite Nike’s anytime, anywhere.</p>

 <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
 <p>During this phase we realized our feature was at the intersection of three areas of interested: Augmented Reality, E-commerce and Customization. So we researched for other apps like Gucci, Adidas that were starting to blend AR and E-commerce and apps like SneakerKit and Wanna Kicks that had very developed AR and Customization Interfaces</p>

 <div class="case-highlight-center">
 <h5>Best Practices</h5>
 <ul class="case-highlight">
 <li>AR Try-On</li>
 <li>High Level of Customization</li>
 <li>Immersive AR Interface</li>
 <li>3D View</li>
 <li>Share Your Nike’s</li>
 <li>Sale Accelerators</li>
 </ul>
 </div>

 <div class="case-highlight-center">
 <h5>Most Valuable Insights</h5>
 <p>We also asked our respondents for some suggestions regarding their online shopping experience and how we could improve this exprience. These are some of the most valuable insights:</p>
 <ul class="case-highlight">
 <li><em>“Being able to select different body types or models that are closer to my size”</em></li>
 <li><em>“360º view of the product”</em></li>
 <li><em>“Size table comparing products from other brands”</em></li>
 <li><em>“Virtual Reality / Virtual Try-On"</em></li>
 </ul>
 </div>

 <div>
 <h3>Analysis</h3>
 <p>In the end of our Research we decided to set these main goals for our feature that had to be assured, so that our feature could feel purposeful.</p>

 <h3>Customer Journey Map</h3>
 <p>This customer Journey Map helped us to anticipate some of the problems that could be raised by our feature. We started by thinking what dynamics we would want to explore and how to make them in a way that it maintains or elevates the already existing standards within NikeApp. This allowed us to measure the pro’s and con’s of AR as an e-commerce vehicle and visualize possible user scenarios and how we could solve them.</p>

 <h3>Prototyping</h3>
 <p>Following the already existing design system, the main additions were the two different ways to view the model: by allowing the user to look at it on a 3D space; and by trying it on their own feet on the “Try on” mode.</p>
