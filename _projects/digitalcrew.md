<h3>What is Digital Crew?</h3>

<p>Digital Crew is a place where digital designers go to get a grasp of what area of digital design they best fit in, based on their actions through a hypothetical first day of work.
Designed to be a relaxed funny quiz, taking advantage of design typical stereotypes, Digital Crew is the perfect tool to learn which area of digital design one fits best.</p>

<p>The quiz takes the user through a hypothetical first day of a new job, answering with the problems with quirky solutions. Depending on their choices, the user would be inserted into one of five groups where, once the results are in, they could explore the possible job titles in that area.</p>

<p>This project seeks to help designers from all status to figure out what area of digital design fits best to their needs and wants. The frustration that takes over after trying to understand what job title fits best and which one to look for when looking out for jobs is demotivating. Therefore, it is important to have a place to gather all the different titles and its meanings, while at the same time it allows one to quickly find a crew where to fit.</p>
