   description: In order to highlight the expression of the futuristic manifestos, the phrase written by Tristan Tzara on the Dada Manifesto emphasizes that the written meaning is not always what it appears to be. This composition is interpreted as using a set of letters, both in repetition, that make them stop looking like words and more like sounds, with the black stripes that hide part of them (as if it were the meaning) and also with the M / W comparison that shows that not everything is what it seems.

   category: Illustration
   description: This was project to promote the “Aldeias de Água” (meaning “water villages” in english) done with a partnership with EDIA, a public company that manages the Alqueva Multipurpose Project. The prompt was to show the beauty of some villages that are now closer to the water due to the construction of the Alqueva dam, and how it brought advantages to those who live there. A book was made with a collection of illustrations and stained glass made by multiple students. There was afterwards an exhibition in EDIA's head office with these works.
