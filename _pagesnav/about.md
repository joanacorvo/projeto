<p>I am Joana Corvo, a Junior Product Designer with a Communication Design degree and a post-graduate student in Digital Experience Design at the Fine Arts Academy, Lisbon University. Through the past years, I have been working on projects that have made me grow as a designer, as well as a person.Besides design and art, my passions envolve music and reading. On my free time you can also catch me binge watching random videos on tecnology (right now I am learning about 3D printing!).</p>
